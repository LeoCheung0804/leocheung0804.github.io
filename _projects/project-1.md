      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The project aimed to develop wearable robots and controllers that enhance human physical abilities and compensate for lost abilities. Specifically, a <strong>Motorized Foot Controller</strong> was built with haptic feedback and trajectory assistance to wirelessly control a <strong>SuperLimb</strong>. The controller also enables seamless interchange between multiple smart home devices using multiple ESP slaves.</p>
      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motorized Foot Controller</strong>: Equipped with haptic feedback and trajectory assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Control</strong>: Facilitates control of SuperLimb and multiple smart home devices.</li>
        <li><strong>API Development</strong>: Built API for the Foot Controller to control SuperLimb and smart home devices interchangeably.</li>
        <li><strong>Ergonomics and Motion Analysis</strong>: Conducted quantitative experiments on foot motion and overall ergonomics, leading to improved motion and control.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanical vs Motorized Analysis</strong>: Comparative analysis of mechanically coupled vs motorized SuperLimb systems.</li>
        <li><strong>BLDC Motors and Encoders Implementation</strong>: Integrated BLDC motors and encoders on both the SuperLimb and Foot Controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Communication System</strong>: Developed a wireless communication system for the SuperLimb.</li>
        <li><strong>Haptic Feedback Functionality</strong>: Implemented haptic feedback to improve user interaction with the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Trajectory Assistance</strong>: Provided trajectory correction to enhance foot gesture accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Foot Motion Analysis</strong>: Conducted detailed analysis of foot motion, improving controller ergonomics.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-device Applications</strong>: Enabled the controller to interact with multiple smart home devices.</li>
        <li><strong>API Development</strong>: Built API for Foot Controller to control SuperLimb and smart home devices interchangeably.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a wireless motorized foot controller, showcasing the importance of haptic feedback and trajectory assistance for enhanced control of a SuperLimb. The results highlight the controller's potential to improve user experience and functionality, particularly for individuals with disabilities or those with unsteady hand movements.</p>
