# MSc Project: Design and Analysis of Wireless Motorized Foot Controller for Enhanced Control of SuperLimb

## Project Overview
The project aimed to develop wearable robots and controllers that enhance human physical abilities and compensate for lost abilities. Specifically, a **Motorized Foot Controller** was built with haptic feedback and trajectory assistance to wirelessly control a **SuperLimb**. The controller also enables seamless interchange between multiple smart home devices using multiple ESP slaves.

### Key Features:
- **Motorized Foot Controller**: Equipped with haptic feedback and trajectory assistance.
- **Wireless Control**: Facilitates control of SuperLimb and multiple smart home devices.
- **API Development**: Built API for the Foot Controller to control SuperLimb and smart home devices interchangeably.
- **Ergonomics and Motion Analysis**: Conducted quantitative experiments on foot motion and overall ergonomics, leading to improved motion and control.

## Contributions
- **Mechanical vs Motorized Analysis**: Comparative analysis of mechanically coupled vs motorized SuperLimb systems.
- **BLDC Motors and Encoders Implementation**: Integrated BLDC motors and encoders on both the SuperLimb and Foot Controller.
- **Wireless Communication System**: Developed a wireless commutation system for the SuperLimb.
- **Haptic Feedback Functionality**: Implemented haptic feedback to improve user interaction with the environment.
- **Trajectory Assistance**: Provided trajectory correction to enhance foot gesture accuracy.
- **Foot Motion Analysis**: Conducted detailed analysis of foot motion, improving controller ergonomics.
- **Multi-device Applications**: Enabled the controller to interact with multiple smart home devices.
- **API Development**: Built API for Foot Controller to control SuperLimb and smart home devices interchangeably.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a wireless motorized foot controller, showcasing the importance of haptic feedback and trajectory assistance for enhanced control of a SuperLimb. The results highlight the controller's potential to improve user experience and functionality, particularly for individuals with disabilities or those with unsteady hand movements.
